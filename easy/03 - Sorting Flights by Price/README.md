# Challenge 03 - Sorting Flights by Price
In this challenge, you are going to be attempting to sort a list of `Flights` based on their price from highest to lowest.

You will have to implement the `SortByPrice` function that takes in a slice of type `Flight` and returns the sorted list of Flights.

In order to help you see what is going on, you have been provided a very quick printFlights function which you can use to print the flights out.
